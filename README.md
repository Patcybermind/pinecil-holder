# pinecil soldering iron holder
this is an adapter to hold a smaller soldering iron inside a bigger soldering iron without the tip touching the side of the iron

notes:
the diameter of the outer ring is like 4.3 cm
its depth is .5 cm so i have to design smth around that
the diameter of the smaller cylinder is around 3.5 cm 
the .blend also has a model of what the holder kinda looks like
